* FCTN decomposition is a new powerful decomposition firstly mentioned in **Fully-Connected Tensor Network Decomposition and Its Application to Higher-Order Tensor Completion**, which breaks through the linear
constraints of traditional approaches via its all-dimensional
interaction topology, enabling more flexible characterization
of cross-dimensional nonlinear patterns.
* Leveraging the superior representational capacity of FCTN, BRFCTN demonstrates **superior recovery performance across diverse visual datasets and multiple noise scenarios**, has better **robustness** and **effectiveness** than the recently RNC-FCTN also based on FCTN framework.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To verify the BRFCTN for data denoising, run:

```matlab
Demo
```

The code will first build the class of BRFCTN:

```matlab
FCTN_vb = FCTN_model(D, Rank, hyperparameters)
```
D is the corrupted tensor, Rank is the predefined FCTN-ranks, and hyperparameters are set as 1e-6 for non-informative prior.

Then initial the model:

```matlab
FCTN_vb = FCTN_vb.initialize()
```
  
Finally run the model:

```matlab
FCTN_vb = FCTN_vb.run(MAX_Iter)
```

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Implementation of the **Bayesian Robust Fully-Connected Tensor Network(BRFCTN)** for hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion.
- Support for various visual datasets such as LFI, Video, and HSI and multiple noise scenarios (especially for mixtrue noise), which demonstrates superior rubustness.
- Leveraging the Bayesian framework, faster model learning efficiency than the recently proposed **Fully-Connected Tensor Network Decomposition for Robust Tensor Completion Problem(RNC-FCTN)**, which is also based on the FCTN framework.
